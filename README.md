## Small E-Commerce Example
For this example, I'm going to use this **[Ecommerce page](https://qa-practice.netlify.app/auth_ecommerce.html)**, which has the following elements to practice: a login, adding items to the shopping cart, and placing an order.

### Suite of tests
✅ Login with default user 
  - Should fill login form and redirect to homepage
  - Should not let you login

✅ Shopping Cart
  - Should add, remove, be visible

✅ Payment
  - Should let user proceed to payment HAPPY PATH
  - Should not let user submit order with wrong form parameters  ‼️**Test failing because the form is not optimized**
  - Should charge you the right price
  
### 🎬Here are the videos of the tests

## API Testing
For this case, I'm going to use **[this page](https://gorest.co.in/)**, which allows us to test the different HTTP methods used in REST APIs.

### Suite of tests
✅ GET & POST 
  - Get user 
  - Send user

✅ PUT
  - POST method to create a user and then updating it with PUT

✅ DELETE 
  - Should delete a user

✅ Weather API Example 
  - Get weather information from different cities

### 🎬Here are the videos of the tests
#### ‼️‼️In this particular case, you won't be able to visually see the HTTP methods, but you will be able to see how the tests function correctly.
 #### GET & POST
